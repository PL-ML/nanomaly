  \emph{Static} type errors are a common stumbling block
  for newcomers to typed functional languages.
  %
  We present a \emph{dynamic} approach to explaining type
  errors by generating counterexample witness inputs that
  illustrate \emph{how} an ill-typed program goes wrong.
  %
  First, given an ill-typed function, we symbolically
  execute the body to dynamically synthesize witness values
  that can make the program go wrong.
  We prove that our procedure synthesizes
  \emph{general witnesses} in that if a witness is
  found, then \emph{for all} inhabited input types, there exist
  values that can make the function go wrong.
  %
  Second, we show how to extend the above procedure to
  produce a \emph{reduction graph} that can be used to
  interactively visualize and debug witness executions.
  %
  Third, we evaluate the coverage of our approach on two data sets
  comprising over 4,500 ill-typed student programs.
  Our technique is able to generate witnesses for
  88\% of the programs, and our reduction graph
  yields small counterexamples for 81\% of the witnesses.
  %
  Finally, we evaluate the utility of our witnesses in
  helping students understand and fix type errors, and
  find that students presented with our witnesses
  consistently show a greater understanding of type errors
  than those presented with a standard error message.
