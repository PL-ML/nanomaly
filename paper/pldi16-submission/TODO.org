* Eric TODO
** GRAPHS
  - [ ] cumulative coverage of benchmarks vs timeout
  - [ ] breakdown of error types (type/unbound/timeout/nothing)
  - [ ] runtime metrics
    - seconds to find witness
    - do we care about how long a SAFE (ie unsuccessful) run takes?
  - [ ] complexity of witnesses
    - # single-steps in trace
    - # "big"-steps in trace
    - others?

** WRITING
  - [ ] formalize interactive semantics
    - [ ] extend op-sem to collect "steps-to" and "subterm" edges
    - [ ] describe exploration "strategies": as graph algorithms
      1. step forward/backward
      2. jump forward/backward
      3. step into
      4. step over
