* Eric TODO
** GRAPHS
  - [X] cumulative coverage of benchmarks vs timeout
    - [X] use wallclock time instead
  - [X] breakdown of error types (type/unbound/timeout/nothing)
    - [X] collapse safe/timeout
    - [X] witness/no-witness instead of safe/unsafe
  - [X] runtime metrics
    - seconds to find witness
    - do we care about how long a SAFE (ie unsuccessful) run takes?
  - [X] complexity of witnesses
    - # single-steps in trace
    - # "big"-steps in trace
    - others?
    - [X] collapse seminal vs ucsd into single chart, use percentage
      

** WRITING
  - [-] formalize interactive semantics
    - [X] extend op-sem to collect "steps-to" and "subterm" edges
    - [ ] describe exploration "strategies": as graph algorithms
      1. step forward/backward
      2. jump forward/backward
      3. step into
      4. step over
  - [ ] Overview
  - [ ] Add more to Program Exploration related (maybe?)
